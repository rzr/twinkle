If you know that the bug you want to report is in the "upstream"
code then please file directly with the twinkle users group:
   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/twinklephone/

If you feel that the bug is one that other Debian users should
know about then you are welcome to file a report in the Debian BTS
as well.  Please keep in mind, however, that managing bug reports
is part of the maintainers' workload.

As a minimum could I ask you to Cc: the usergroup twinklephone@yahoogroups.com
for upstream issues so they are aware of any issues we have.
