- G.711 codec from Sun Microsystems
The files in this directory comprise ANSI-C language reference implementations
of the CCITT (International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee)
G.711, G.721 and G.723 voice compressions.  They have been tested on Sun
SPARCstations and passed 82 out of 84 test vectors published by CCITT
(Dec. 20, 1988) for G.721 and G.723.  [The two remaining test vectors,
which the G.721 decoder implementation for u-law samples did not pass,
may be in error because they are identical to two other vectors for G.723_40.]
